			["Lab Pass", [["How do I purchase a Lab Pass?","The Lab Pass can be purchased on <a href=\"index.php\">this page</a>. Choose from one of the three plans, depending on how much time you'd like to prepay for.<br /><br /> The one-year Lab Pass is the best deal."],
						["What is included with a Lab Pass?","The <a href=\"features.php\">Lab Pass Features Page</a> has a breakdown of the benefits of owning a Lab Pass.<br /><br />Each Lab Pass also comes with an instant Cred bonus:<br /><ul><li>1-Month Lab Pass: <b>Bonus 1,000 Cred</b></li><li>6-Month Lab Pass: <b>Bonus 6,000 Cred</b></li><li>12-Month Lab Pass: <b>Bonus 12,000 Cred</b></li></ul>"],
						["Which payment options are supported?","We currently support Lab Pass purchases through PayPal.  PayPal accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and E-Check, all without the need for a PayPal account.  For customers with a PayPal account, payment via PayPal balance or direct bank account withdraw are also supported."],

		                 	   ["How do I control my character?","Movement is controlled with the directional keys on the keyboard, or the WASD keys. Aiming and firing is controlled with the mouse, by pointing and clicking in the direction you want to fire. Hold down the mouse button to fire continuously."],					   
					   ["Why does my character keep getting killed?","Stick Arena is a competitive game with bit of a learning curve, and new players can be overwhelmed at times by more experienced players. Keep practicing! You'll find that your skills improve over time."],
					   ["The game is running slowly, is there any thing I can do to improve performance?","You can alleviate the issue by opening the options panel from the icon in the lower left (during game play) and setting the detail option to 'low' and particles to 'off'. In most cases, players located outside in the Eastern Hemisphere will experience better gameplay by switching to the European Server, using the dropdown box in the upper right corner of the lobby.<br /><br />Due to a quirk with the flash player, you can also adversely affect performance during gameplay by rapidly clicking to fire your weapon. We recommend holding down the fire button in those situations, which will cause your weapon to fire as rapidly as it is able."],
					   ["Why does my character continue moving on his own?","A flash bug can cause your character to continuously move, try pressing any of the movement keys on WASD, arrows or the numpad to clear this move action."],
					   ["Is there any way to see detailed information about FPS (Frames Per Second) or my ping to the server?","Press ~ (tilde) to toggle FPS, Aggregate Ping, and Personal Ping display.  Hit ~ again to show each player's individual Ping time.  Hit ~ once more to hide Ping/FPS information."],
